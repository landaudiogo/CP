priority queues are the obvious application of this structure. 

To perform the partial_sort in the c++ stl algorithm library, one of the possible implementations is by processing the elements one by one and creating a Max Heap of k elements, removing the largest element whenever its size exceeds k (k is the number of elemetns requested by user). The smallest k elements can then be obtained in descending order by continuously removing the largest element of the heap. 

It is also used for famous algorithms such as the Minimum Spanning tree, Single-Source Shortest Paths, and the A* Search algorithm.
