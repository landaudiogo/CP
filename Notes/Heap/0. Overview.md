The following explanations will be described using a max heap tree. These conditions still hold if we change to the Min heap tree, but applying the minimum logic instead of the max.

Within a max heap, any subtree has to have as root node the maximum element. This means that no child of the root node, is bigger than this element.

Another condition is that it has to be a complete tree. This means that a layer of depth isn't added before all the previous layers have been completely filled. 

It is also common to store this data structure in an array (reference to book to understand the indexing of the heap to the array). The consequence of doing this type of indexing allows easy access to the element of a node by simple index manipulation. These operations are:
- parent: truc(i/2);
- left child: i*2;
- right child: i*2 + 1;

This can also be done more efficiently using bit manipulation i<<2, i>>2, i>>2 +1 respectively.

It is common to use this kind of structure for a priority queue representation.
