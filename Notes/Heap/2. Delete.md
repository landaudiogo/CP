To delete the maximum element (root node) the last node in the array structure overwrites the root node, and compared with both it's child nodes. If it is smaller than any, then it has to be swapped with the largest child node. When there are no more child nodes that are bigger than the inserted node then no more swapping occurs and the process has terminated.
