# Right Rotation

Making use of the illustration in the above link, the right rotation allows for two nodes to switch mainting BST consistency.

x becomes the parent of y, and y the child of x, "switching" roles. To maintain consistency, as x < y (as it is on the left), then when x becomes parent, it goes to the right child of x. As such, the node (or subtree) that was previously in the right child node of x, goes to the position x occupied in y.

# Left Rotation

The left rotation is very similar to what was previously described.

The difference is that in the previous cenario, the child was on the left node, creating an illusion of a right rotation. In this case, the child belongs to the right node of the parent, and switches in the same manner as the previous case. 

So what happens is the child becomes parent and the parent child, but in this case, the child is bigger than the parent, so when the switch occurs the before parent goes to the left of the before child switching position with the node that was previously there.
