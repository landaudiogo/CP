The inorder successor is equivalent to the greatest smallest key to the one on the current node. This is performed by traversing the left tree, continuosly searching the right nodes. when there are no more right nodes to visit then the current node is the inorder successor.

The process is similar for the inorder predecessor. 
The goal is to find a key which is bigger than the one on the current node, but also smaller than all the keys on the right sub-tree. As such, starting on the right subtree, the left node is visited until there no longer is a left node to travel to. When this node is reached the inorder predecessor has been found.

This is used for the deletion process of a BST.
