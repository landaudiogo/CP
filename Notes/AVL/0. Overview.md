> http://www.cs.emory.edu/~cheung/Courses/253/Syllabus/Trees/AVL.html

The objective of the AVL tree is to keep the tree as balanced as possible in every node of the tree. This means that the difference in height of each child node cannot be bigger than 1.

## Advantages

The reason this structure was created was to improve search times for keys.

## Disadvantages

This structure and strict rules, lead to longer insert and remove operations.
